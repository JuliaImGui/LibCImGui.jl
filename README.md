Julia language binding for [cimgui](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui)(docking
branch), [cimplot](https://github.com/cimgui/cimplot), and
[cimnodes](https://github.com/cimgui/cimnodes).

The code the bindings are generated from come from the
[CImGuiPack](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/tree/master/C/CImGuiPack)
JLL, which is built from the
[cimgui-pack](https://github.com/JuliaImGui/cimgui-pack) repo. Note that the
versioning of this repo *does not* exactly match upstream Dear ImGui, we only
match the major and minor version. The patch version is specific to
LibCImGui.jl. See the release notes for the exact Dear ImGui version used for
each LibCImGui.jl release.

## Installation
```
pkg> add LibCImGui
```

If you are looking for a high-level Julian API you might wish to take a look at [CImGui.jl](https://github.com/Gnimuc/CImGui.jl).

## Updating
The bindings for the different platforms in [lib/](lib/) are generated by the
files in [gen/](gen/). To update the bindings you'll first need to update
`CImGuiPack_jll`, then run:
```
julia --project=gen generator.jl
```

The first time might take a while since it has to download artifacts for each
platform.
